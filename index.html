    <h1><center>A Few Things</center></h1>

    <p2><center><em> Below is some stuff I thought I'd share to practice. I used the iframe tag to embed applications from other websites. I used the figure and figcaption tags to add images and text.  I downloaded the Lato front from Google Fonts, inserted it with a style link in the header, and changed the color. I used the a tag to add a few hyperlinks to other sites. I used the blockquote tag to format longer quoted text in a couple places. I used the div tag to make little spacers with dingbats. Finally I used another div tag to put the whole site contents in a dotted box. This was fun! If anyone has figured out an easy way to align elements side by side instead of stacking them, let's connect! I'd love to learn. - Thomas</em></center></p2>

    <center><p1>Here's a bird I'm loving lately. The Scaly-breasted Munia, <em>lonchura punctulata</em>. There are about 20 of them that live in the bamboo in my backyard and all pile onto the birdfeeder together.</p1></center>

     <figcaption><p2>The second edition of <em>Sibley Birds West</em> has this to say about them:<blockquote>"Native to Asia. Large populations established and spreading in Southern California. Note very small size, unmarked wings, large dark bill, and short pointed tail. Found in weedy areas such as vacant lots and stream floodplains. Also known as Nutmeg Mannikin or Spice Finch. Song of high <em>tik</em> notes and thing scratchy whistles, very inconspicuous. Call a sharp high <em>pidee</em> repeated in chorus by flock; reminiscent of Least Tern. Also quiet, thin, scratchy or nasal notes."</blockquote>Photo by: Sugan Raj Bharathi, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</p2></figcaption>

    <center><p1>I had never really read any Twain outside of <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> in school, but last year I read <em>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</em> on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed it. The titular Yankee gets bumped on the head, wakes up in early medieval England, and promtply begins re-inventing 19th century society. You can read the whole book right here, courtesy of the Internet Archive.</p1></center>

    <center><p2>I was struck by the Yankee's use of the phrase "new deal" during a monologue in which he decries the opressed condition of the masses of serfs and imagines how he might instigate democracy (scroll to page 108 if you want to see for yourself). Turns out FDR was a big Twain fan and took some inspiration from the book. Twain's cousin Cyril Clemens recalls the following <a href=https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/57803/dalrev_vol25_iss3_pp339_341.pdf>conversation</a> with the President:</p2></center>

    <center><p2><blockquote>"Did you know, Mr. President, that the slogan of your administration was used by Twain in the Connecticut Yankee?" "Yes, certainly I was aware of that fact," he smilingly answered, "for it was there that I obtained the phrase. You recall the Yankee's saying that he was in a country where a right to say how the country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each thousand of its population...I felt the same way about conditions in America." </blockquote></p2></center>
